You can use this widget regardless of whether you are blogger on BloggersBase or not. However, joining BloggersBase can make this widget even more beneficiary. Your posts can appear in this widget as well and the more people use this widget, so grows the exposure of your posts - all the BloggersBase users are in fact helping each other. You also spread the word about BloggersBase, which in turn will translate into more exposure to your content, your blog and your posts. 

Moreover, this widget participates in our referral program, which means that if someone registers to BloggersBase through the widget on your site, we keep that on your record.
